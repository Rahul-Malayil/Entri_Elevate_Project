Electric vehicle type prediction

Introduction

As the automotive industry transitions toward sustainable and eco-friendly solutions, electric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant attention. Among the various types of EVs, Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are the most commonly discussed. BEVs are fully electric, relying solely on batteries for propulsion, while PHEVs combine a conventional internal combustion engine with an electric motor, offering both battery and gasoline-powered driving options.
With the growing variety of EVs in the market, accurately predicting whether a vehicle is a BEV or PHEV based on its features is essential. This prediction can benefit manufacturers, consumers, and policymakers in making informed decisions, optimizing production, and supporting the infrastructure needed for EV adoption.

#Objective


The primary objective of this project is to build a predictive model that classifies electric vehicles into Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The model will use various vehicle parameters, such as battery capacity, range, fuel type, and other specifications, to make this classification.


#Goal


The goal of this project is to:

1. Develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the type of EV based on input data.

2. Provide insights into the key factors influencing the classification between BEVs and PHEVs.

3. Support decision-making for consumers in selecting the right EV, for manufacturers to target production more effectively, and for policymakers to design infrastructure that meets the needs of different EV types.
By achieving these objectives, the project aims to contribute to the efficient adoption and implementation of electric vehicles across various sectors.
